In this project I basically customized my Bluetooth Mode Detection application layout apparently published in the MIT App Inventor 2 website.In this concept,I basically designed an android mobile application version of application layout which can be downloaded anywhere in .apk format and in any devices.The layout basically consists of buttons on/off using and the frame was created using logical and sequentially analyzed blocks from MIT App Inventor 2 website.The color customizations made overall in the layout is generally attractive and if the switch off is pressed,without connecting to Bluetooth then it will be showing as invalid options as a part of an initial touch up without any pre-requisites even in the form of basics coding concepts
